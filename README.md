# Kings-Empires-Bot
Multiplayer Gaming Telegram Bot

This is my made game Telegram bot, which did not find commercial success and I decided to upload it.
You can use this pre-project for your own purposes, it is disposed under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
Some bot modules need to be changed due to bugs.

## Game
The game is a City Planning Simulator, Real Time Strategy, in Telegram chat.
Some models and mechanics were taken from the Forge of Empires, Clash of Clans.

## Frameworks
The main framework - [Aiogram](https://docs.aiogram.dev/) asynchronous framework for Telegram Bot API written in Python. Second most important framework - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for the Database on SQLite3.

## Note
This is was only my project for not someone. You willn't find comments and all other elements for open source projects.
